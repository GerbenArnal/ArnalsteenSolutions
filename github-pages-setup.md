# GitHub Pages Setup - Complete Guide

## Quick Setup (3 Steps)

### 1. Upload to GitHub
- Create new repository named `ArnalsteenSolutions`
- Upload all your project files
- Make sure repository is **public** (required for free GitHub Pages)

### 2. Auto-Deploy Setup
Your project now includes automatic deployment! Just push to GitHub and it deploys automatically.

The `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file will:
- Build your static site automatically
- Deploy to GitHub Pages on every push to main branch

### 3. Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to repository Settings > Pages
2. Source: "Deploy from a branch"
3. Branch: `gh-pages`
4. Folder: `/ (root)`
5. Save

**Your site will be live at:** `https://gerbanarnal.github.io/ArnalsteenSolutions/`

## What Works on GitHub Pages

✅ **Full Visual Experience**
- All extreme animations and effects
- Neon color schemes and holographic gradients
- 3D transforms and particle systems
- Responsive design across all devices

✅ **Navigation & Content**
- Smooth scrolling navigation
- All sections (Hero, Services, About, Portfolio)
- Interactive hover effects

⚠️ **Contact Form**
- Shows professional message directing users to email
- Form validation still works
- Better user experience than broken submission

## Alternative Hosting (Full Backend)

If you want the contact form to work fully:

**Vercel** (Recommended - Free)
1. Import from GitHub at vercel.com
2. Vercel automatically handles both frontend and backend
3. Contact form works completely

**Netlify**
1. Import from GitHub at netlify.com
2. Add serverless functions for contact form

**Railway/Render**
1. Full backend support
2. Database integration if needed
